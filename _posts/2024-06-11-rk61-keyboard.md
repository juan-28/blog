title: "Rediscovering My Old RK61 Keyboard: Making it Mac and Code Compatible"

Recently, I stumbled upon my old RK61 keyboard with red switches while cleaning out my desk. I remembered why I stopped using it after switching to a Mac: the layout wasn't quite right for macOS, leading to several frustrating issues. Determined to make it work, I decided to give it another shot and solve the compatibility problems.

### The Problems

#### Forward Slash Button
One of the biggest issues I faced was with the forward slash button. On the RK61, this button could only be pressed after changing the function layout by pressing `Fn` + `Enter`. This remapped the up arrow to a forward slash, but then I lost the functionality of the up arrow. This constant switching became a hassle, especially when coding or navigating through documents.

#### Tilde Key
Another challenge was typing the tilde (`~`) using the escape button. I couldn't figure out the right key combination to make it work. This was particularly problematic when working with the terminal or writing Markdown files.

#### Modifier Keys
On a Mac, the left-side modifier keys are arranged as follows:


However, the RK61 recognized the command button as the option button, and vice versa. This mismatch made it difficult to use shortcuts efficiently, and my muscle memory from using the Mac keyboard wasn't translating well to the RK61.

### The Solution: Karabiner-Elements

To address these issues, I turned to Karabiner-Elements, a powerful and flexible key remapping tool for macOS. Instead of configuring each key manually, I've created a custom rule that can be easily imported from the web. Here's how you can set it up.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Download and Install Karabiner-Elements**:
   First, download Karabiner-Elements from [their official website](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/). Follow the installation instructions to get it set up on your Mac.

2. **Open Karabiner-Elements**:
   Once installed, open Karabiner-Elements from your Applications folder.

3. **Import My Custom Rule**:
   - Go to the `Complex Modifications` tab.
   - Click on `Add rule` and then `Import more rules from the Internet`.
   - Search for the custom rule I created for the RK61 keyboard. You can find it by searching for my username or the specific rule name.
   - Import the rule and enable it.

4. **Test Your Configuration**:
   - Open a text editor or terminal and test all the remapped keys.
   - Ensure the modifier keys behave as expected, and the forward slash and tilde keys are easily accessible.

### Final Thoughts

After importing the custom rule in Karabiner-Elements, my RK61 keyboard is now fully functional with my Mac. The forward slash and tilde keys are easily accessible, and the modifier keys are correctly mapped. This setup allows me to code efficiently without worrying about key access or layout issues.

If you have an RK61 or any other keyboard with similar compatibility issues, I highly recommend giving Karabiner-Elements a try and importing my custom rule. The transition from my Macbook Air to the RK61 is seamless and I am so much faster at typing, thanks to the mechanical keyboard switches. I also didn't have to deal with the software that comes with the keyboard (which is only available for windows)
